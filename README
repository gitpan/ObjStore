ObjStore       am+O  ObjectStore DBMS Interface                   JPRIT

Easy, flexible, lightning-fast persistent via ObjectStore.  Stores
scalars, arrays, hashes, and references without any flattening.
The perl tie interface is used to make access completely transparent.
The schema is also designed to easily support direct access from native
C++ applications.  MOP support is planed for editing and reporting on
arbitrary schemas.  100GB databases can be created and managed completely
in perl5 with vastly better performance than Oracle or Informix!
