./t/z_ospeek.t is very sensitive to the success of the other tests.

'make test' twice!  Since the test database now has data, different
code is exercised the second time.

If you have a problem with objectstore::get_unassigned_address_space(), 
just delete the code chunk and keep going.  This API is only available
with OS 5.0 service pack #2.

If you succeed on a system that is not listed in above, please send
a note to perl-objectstore@parallax.co.uk announcing your success!
