Optimize for flexibility, then memory performance, then speed.

1. Flexibility
Flexibility is the most important because ObjectStore should be
easier to use and everyone complains that it can't do SQL.
We'll show 'em!

2. Memory Performance
Memory performance is also very important due to the potential size of
databases.  Small memory efficiency improvements in a 5TB database
have a big impact.

3. Speed
Speed is pretty good already, compared to a relational database.
Of course, there is always room for improvement!


+ IDEAS +

Better test scripts?

Strings can be turned into BLOBs and back.  BLOBs support various
indexing, including Verity TOM.  Verity full text indexing.

Support for abort_top_level(), acquire_lock(), and transaction hooks.

Support for notification, database access control?

Support for the database utility API, os_object_cursor?  Who cares?

ospeek option to re-bless all classes?

Avoid stomping on some other version of ref,bless?

Track down any/all XS transient memory leaks.  (Any?)


+ CORE-PERL WISH LIST +

There should be a less kludgy way to extend bless and ref.  Why aren't
these special methods of UNIVERSAL?  :-(

Why do FIRSTKEY, NEXTKEY accept a string instead of a (string, length) pair
or an (SV*)?  The TIE interfaces should be more XS friendly!

Make 'reftype' an official built-in!


+ BIGGISH PROJECTS +

Split out representations into their own shared libraries.  Requires
support for multiple application schemas (expected 1Q98).

Fix the TIEARRAY interface.

Add support for parts of the TimeSeries Object Manager?  Wait for
dynamic application schemas.

Could perl performance be improve?  Streamline typemap?

Add MOP support for editing & reporting of abritrary databases. [HARD]
Object Design working on this problem?

Expand Maker to encompass all architectures/compilers/situations.
Integrate with and replace MakeMaker?  Why bother?
