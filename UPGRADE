Database Version	Evolve With
----------------------- ----------------
up to 1.16		1.17
1.17 +			(you're cool already)


** osp_evolve

You must use osp_evolve instead of ossevol.  

  osp_evolve <workdb> <evolvedb>+

osp_evolve is relatively fast.  It took 8 minutes to evolve a 32MB
database on an Ultra 1 running Solaris.  If you get an error about
avarray, just add '-i avarray' to the command line.


** osp_copy

You can also re-copy your databases with osp_copy.  It is more of a
proof-of-concept than a useful tool, since it takes about 8-10 times
at long as osp_evolve.  It does do a lot of interesting stuff,
however, and is written completely in perl.
