- ./t/z_ospeek.t is very sensitive to the success of the other tests.

- 'make test', then save the output of 'ossize -c'.  Run 'make test'
again and compare 'ossize -c' to the last snapshot.  The only thing
that might be different is the addition of another empty segment (this
is a known bug in safe references, example below).  If anything else
changes, there is a serious refcnt bug!

Data segment 6:
Size: 1024 bytes (1 Kbytes)
 Singles   Arrays    Total   Obj Sz   Total Sz  Type
       0        2      628        1        628  (unused space)
       0        1       10       12        128  _Hash_table_entry<unsigned int,void*>

- If you have a problem with objectstore::get_unassigned_address_space(), 
just delete the code chunk and keep going.  This API is only available
with OS 5.0 service pack #2.
