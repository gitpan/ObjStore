** 08-11-97 Released 1.10

- Overloaded the '""' (stringify) operator for persistent objects.

- ospeek [-addr]

- Important typemap fixes plus other minor stuff.

- No schema changes.


** 08-06-97 Released 1.09

- At our site we are now using osperl for about 2GB worth of data!

- Now built to a shared library!!  Anyone up for Apache/Perl/ObjectStore?

- New, Improved Documentation.

- Persistent blessings now fully tested and working.

- ObjectStore transactions and exceptions now fully integrated into
Perl.  Cursors have been removed from persistent data; read_only
transactions now properly supported.  Read_only transactions are
blazingly fast!

- Regularized allocators.  Specify cardinality when creating containers.
  new ObjStore::$type($near, $card);  Customize representation selector.

- Regularized peristent typing in preparation for extensibility.

- Peek rewrite with ideas from Data::Dumper.  Peek on circular data
structures.  Peek reports percent utilization to the delight of the
accountants everywhere.

- Unions removed from the schema.  This major fix makes it possible to
evolve databases in the event of future schema enhancements.

- Reference counts are now 32bits wide and check for overflow.

- Static functions (e.g. ObjStore::Segment::of) are now called with ::
instead of -> for greater efficiency.

- Plus hundreds of fixes...


** 08-02-97 Released 1.08

- Release canidate for 1.09.


** 07-05-97 Released 1.06 

- Improved peek.  Now peek from the command line - 'ospeek <database>'!

- Database::get_all_roots Root::get_name

- Fixes...


** 07-03-97 Released 1.05

- ObjectStore exceptions trigger a dump of the perl call stack.

- Peek on sacks.

- Bug fixes.

- $store->set_fetch_policy(os_fetch_policy, os_int32)


** Released 1.03

- Investigated schema evolution.  Will provide a database evolver
going forward.

- Can't wait for reasonable tied arrays!  Added array-based Sacks.
They're not tied, but at least they're inefficient.

- Found and fixed problems with reference counting.  Now the tests
can be run and the database does not grow.

- Blessings are now persistent!  (Untested)

- Re-designed the make system again.

- Started writing documentation.  (Yawn.)


** Released 1.02

- Improved make file.  Fixed blib.  Usage now looks like this:

perl ./be [-nop] [-silent] [-verbose] <cmd>
   checked      - verify that the package is complete
   made         - run the compiler, toast the pop-tarts, etc.
   installed    - copy files to final install area
   uninstalled  - delete any files that were installed
   cleaned      - delete all temporary files
   manifest     - update the MANIFEST file
   dist         - create a tar.gz distribution file

- Fixed version numbering for Exporter.  1.2 => 1.02

- Added ObjStore::peek($var) - like Data::Dumper except that it will work better
on gigantic databases.  Only three elements are printed from large hashes,
while small hashes are printed completely.  The meaning of 'large' can be
customized (not yet).

- Installs PoweredByOS.gif and publishes the path.


** Released 1.00

- The first release, written during our ObjectStore 60 day evaluation.
Why does anyone think that ObjectStore is difficult to work with?
