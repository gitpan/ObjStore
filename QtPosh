QtPosh 2.00 Project

- GUI toolkit will be PerlQt 2.000+.

- Hypertext click-to-nagivate interface.

- Code needs to be reorganized to maximize sharing:
  posh
  ObjStore::Peeker
  ObjStore::Posh::*

- POSH_PEEK needs to be redesigned to integrate with hyperlinks.

- Things should work mostly the same whether the database is being
accessed directly or via osperlserver.
