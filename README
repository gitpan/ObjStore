What do you get when you cross a mission-critical enterprise-class
database with a camel?

** 01-24-98 RELEASE 1.26

- Preliminary support for exceptions on Digital Unix AXP (and other
platforms for which ODI exploits ANSI C++ exceptions).

- Fat-Tree array representation.

- The Fat-Tree code was re-factored and the memory layout changed.
Unfortunately, any indices created with a prior version will need to
be dropped (before upgrading) and re-built (after upgrading).  Either
this or a schema evolution (yikes!) is necessary.  All other data
should migrate without a hiccup.


** 01-18-98 RELEASE 1.25

- Completed test coverage analysis of the C++ code (with the
assistance of Devel::CCov).  A number of minor bugs were uncovered and
fixed.  Most notable bug: splash hashes did not take advantage of
already empty slots during STORE (I never claimed they were a model of
efficiency :-).

- Fixed: problems when doing updates while two databases are open, one
in mvcc mode and one in update mode.  $db->is_writable is now the
preferred method to determine if you can update data.

- Split each group of collection representations into its own XS file.
Optimized creation of new persistent objects.  (This may cause
backward compatibility problems if you were passing an exact
representation type to a 'new' method.)  The 'new' method will be
auto-generated at compile-time in a forthcoming release.
