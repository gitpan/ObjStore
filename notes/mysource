NOTES

o Some of my code might be hard to read.  Imagine how hard it was to
write.

o Functions or methods starting with '_' are internal to the ObjStore
extension.  They are subject to change entirely without notice.

o Avoid const, privacy, & templates.  C++ sucks.  Long live C++!

o The relationship between references and cursors is strange.  It's
probably best not to think about it.

o Coding XS is very strange and very cool.

o gdb - handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint pass

o dbx - stop in `ObjStore.so`XS_ObjStore__Transaction_SEGV_reason
