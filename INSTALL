------------------------------------------------------------ INSTALLATION

*** IF DO NOT HAVE (AND CANNOT UPGRADE) TO OBJECTSTORE 5.1, YOU SHOULD ***
*** STICK WITH VERSION 1.41 OF THIS EXTENSION!!                        ***


Tested Configurations:


+ perl 5.005


+ Solaris 2.5.1 (2.6 should work too)

  SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C++ 4.1 / ObjectStore 5.1

  ** REQUIRED: ODI fix #13866 (_Rep_desc_type_table::dope_compatible
  forgets to fixup name key in name hash table)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** BUILD STEPS

1. edit ./lib/ObjStore/Config.pm

2. cd API; perl Makefile.PL; make install

3. cd ..; perl Makefile.PL

4. make

5. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=blib/arch/auto/ObjStore make test  (or somesuch)

6. make install

You have to install the API separately before building the rest of the
package since everything depends on libosperl.so being in the right
place.  (There must be a better way?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST SUITE

- ./t/zpeek.t is very sensitive to the success of the other tests.

- Keep running 'make test' until the database size matches.  It takes
me about three trials.  If it will not match, there is probably a
serious REFCNT problem.  If you are feeling paranoid, you can check
that object counts do not increase between runs with 'ossize -c
<database>'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TROUBLE SHOOTING

- Depending on the platform and whether you built perl to a shared or
static library, you might need to disable perl's malloc.  This does
not seem to be necessary on Solaris 2.X.

- If you need to get a stack trace of an ObjectStore exceptions,
you'll need to use the following breakpoints:

stop in `ObjStore.so`XS_ObjStore__Transaction_SEGV_reason
stop in `libc.so.1`abort
ignore SEGV
cont
