** Installation


Tested Systems:
   sun4-solaris / SunPro 4.0 C++ / ObjectStore 4.0 or better


The build process is a bit radical and needs some hand-holding.

1. perl ./be helpful

2. Make any necessary changes and run 'perl ./be'.

3. It should build an './blib/bin/osperl' binary and run the test scripts.
   './t/hash.t' fails 2/4 until bugrep015834 is fixed.

4. 'perl ./be installed'


If you suceed at building on a system that is not listed in above,
please send a message to the mailing list announcing your success!
