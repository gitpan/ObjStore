What do you get when you cross a mission-critical enterprise-class
database with a camel?

** 01-27-98 RELEASE 1.27

- Digital Unix AXP portability tweaks.  No functional changes.


** 01-24-98 RELEASE 1.26

- Preliminary support for exceptions on Digital Unix AXP (and other
platforms for which ODI exploits ANSI C++ exceptions).

- Fat-Tree array representation.

- The Fat-Tree code was re-factored and the memory layout changed.
Unfortunately, any indices created with a prior version will need to
be dropped (before upgrading) and re-built (after upgrading).  Either
this or a schema evolution (yikes!) is necessary.  All other data
should migrate without a hiccup.


see ./INSTALL for hints on installation
see ./UPGRADE to evolve databases from prior releases
see ./TODO for a list of stuff in the queue
see ./CHANGES for a visionary perspective
