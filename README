ObjStore - Perl Extension For C<ObjectStore> OODBMS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

implements databases that look exactly like normal perl.  The same can
also be extended with arbitrary C++ objects (!).

  or MS Windows NT/95; send email)

=head1 R!CENT CHANGES


** 09-26-98 RELEASE 1.47

- WARNING: the fatal_exceptions option is now always OFF.

- Binary API changes are now detected at run-time.  This is more
consistant with the rest of the perl world.

- Fixed coredump when seeking to an incomplete key.

- Add ObjStore::UNIVERSAL::DELETED method.  Use this flag to announce
that an object is queued for unconditional destruction.

- ObjStore::Mortician wasn't restarting properly.  Fixed.

- Internal adjustments necessary for ObjStore::Lib::PDL.

- Culled more statistics from ObjStore::Serve.  Switched to safe signal
handling.


** 09-12-98 RELEASE 1.46

- Use PERL5PREFIX to install into a different directory tree.

- Improved ObjStore::Index::POSH_PEEK.  Made pretty.

- Shell-style output redirection >> for posh.

- Improved the design of the ObjStore::Serve::defaultLoop.  Reduced
excessive statistics.

- Improved ObjStore::Table3::fetch in an array context.

- Added cast-to-integer overloading for ObjStore::UNIVERSAL.  For
example, $hash{ 0+$object }=1.

- Fixed posh reporting of forced-loaded packages.

- Reduced the number of potential "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar
during global destruction" warnings (hopefully!).

- Improved various diagnostic messages.

- Documentation corrections & updates.
