ObjStore       Rm+O  ObjectStore OODBMS Interface                 JPRIT

Interface to ObjectStore OODBMS (http://www.odi.com).  Stores perl
data directly in the database without flattening of either nested or
cyclic structures.  Includes interactive perl shell for examining and
editing arbitrary databases.  Virtual memory mechanism is used to make
access nearly as fast as memory mapped files.

Available via http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/ObjStore

### RECENT CHANGES ###


** 10-10-97 Released 1.17

- PERL / OBJECTSTORE SHELL !!

- First-class cursors for all persistent types.

- osp_copy script to copy databases.  Source code included.

- Support for cross database references.

- Simplified API for 'open'.

- Sets depreciated.  The interface is there, but they are
re-implemented with hashes.


** 10-03-97 Released 1.16

- All transient data related to persistent memory is now garbage
collected immediately after a transaction finishes.  This should fix
any strange reference count problems that extensive testing has been
uncovering.  I am very interested to see any examples of code that
still leaks memory.  To recover memory already lost, a script to copy
databases is in the works.

- The default stargate now destroys data as it is copied into the
database.  This is necessary to prevent the inadvertant creation of
uncollectable cyclic structures.
