=head1 NAME

ObjStore - Perl Extension For C<ObjectStore> OODBMS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Like perl?  Sick of SQL?  Ready to try something new?  This extension
implements databases that look exactly like normal perl.  The same can
also be extended with arbitrary C++ objects (!).

=head1 PREREQUISITES

You will need:

- ObjectStore 5.1 (see http://www.odi.com; evaluations are available!)

- Perl 5.005 (5.004_04 might still work too)

- Tree::Fat perl extension

- ExtUtils::ExCxx (only needed on Digital UNIX, HP (5.x), OS/2 (3.x),
  or MS Windows NT/95; send email)

See http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/JPRIT/ !

- Use PERL5PREFIX to install into a different directory tree.

- Improved ObjStore::Index::POSH_PEEK.  Made pretty.

excessive statistics.
