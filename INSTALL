** Installation


Supported systems:
   sun4-solaris / SunPro 4.0 C++ / ObjectStore 5.0


The build process is non-standard and needs some hand-holding.  (Sorry!)

1. Type './m help'  This is a new-style makefile!

2. Make the necessary changes and run './m'.

3. It should build an './osperl' binary and run the test scripts.
   './t/hash.t' fails 2/4 until bugrep015834 is fixed.

4. './m install'
