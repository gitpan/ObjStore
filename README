=head1 NAME

ObjStore - Perl Extension For C<ObjectStore> OODBMS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The new C<SQL> and the sunset of relational databases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ObjectStore is the market leader in object-oriented databases
http://www.odi.com (NASDAQ: ODIS).  They use a Cache-Forward
Architecture to make persistent data available in literally the most
efficient manner possible.

Prior to this joining of forces: ObjectStore was too radical a design
decision for many applications; and perl5 did not have a simple way of
storing complex data persistently.

Now there is an easy way to build database applications, especially if
you are concerned about preserving your ideals of data encapsulation.

=head1 WHAT IS PERSISTENT PERL?

It's just like normal perl, except that you can create data that
doesn't go away when your program exits.  This more permenant data
lives in files or raw disk partitions that are divided into databases.
And databases are comprised of...

=head1 PREREQUISITES

If you want to find out, you need:

- ObjectStore OODBMS - see http://www.odi.com
- Perl 5.004_04 (or perl 5.005, once available)
- Tree::Fat & Test extensions
- ExtUtils::ExCxx (only needed on Digital UNIX, HP (5.x), OS/2 (3.x),
  or MS Windows NT/95; send email)

# RECENT CHAN@ES #

** 02-08-98 RELEASE 1.28

- Relaxed overly strict index behavior.  Fixed performance of add &
remove for non-unique indices.  Fixed a serious bug when seeking
unique indices.  Path traverse silently ignores records when there is
a missing key or undef'd slot.  Fixed index comparison for mixed
numeric values.  Added more tests.

- Tweaked ObjStore::AVHV evolution code.  Indexed records temporarily
cannot be evolved due to const.  This will be fixed shortly.

- posh accepts [more] command line args.  Command-line perl code is no
longer partially committed (this was an artifact of the incomplete
integration between eval and transactions).

- Improved CSV module.

- Try to create the cache directory on startup.  (See $OS_CACHE_DIR)

- Next on the list: complete tied array support!


** 01-24-98 RELEASE 1.26

- Preliminary support for exceptions on Digital Unix AXP (and other
platforms for which ODI exploits ANSI C++ exceptions).

- Fat-Tree array representation.

- The Fat-Tree code was re-factored and the memory layout changed.
Unfortunately, any indices created with a prior version will need to
be dropped (before upgrading) and re-built (after upgrading).  Either
this or a schema evolution (yikes!) is necessary.  All other data
should migrate without a hiccup.
