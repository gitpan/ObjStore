ObjStore       am+O  ObjectStore DBMS Interface                   JPRIT

Easy, flexible, lightning-fast persistent via ObjectStore.  Stores
scalars, hashes, and references without any flattening.  The perl tie
interface is used to make access completely transparent.  The schema
is also designed to easily support direct access from native C++ and
potentially Java.  MOP support is planed for editing and reporting on
arbitrary schemas.  100GB databases can be created and managed
completely in Perl5 with vastly better performance than Oracle or
Informix!

### CHANGES ###


** Released 1.02

- Improved makefile.  Fixed blib.  Usage now looks like this:

perl ./be [-nop] [-silent] [-verbose] <cmd>
   checked      - verify that the package is complete
   made         - run the compiler, etc.
   installed    - copy files to final install area
   uninstalled  - delete any files that were installed
   cleaned      - delete all temporary files
   manifested   - update the MANIFEST file
   guitarred    - create a tar.gz distribution file

- Fixed version numbering for Exporter.  1.2 => 1.02

- Added ObjStore::peek($var) - like Data::Dumper except that it will work better
on gigantic databases.  Only three elements are printed from large hashes,
while small hashes are printed completely.  The meaning of 'large' can be
customized (not yet).
