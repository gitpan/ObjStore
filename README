database with a camel?

** 01-10-98 RELEASE 1.24

- The index readonly locking has been tweaked again.  You'll need to
re-create any indices.  Let me know if I got it right this time!

- Re-organized the logic of blessing with significant performance
improvement.  Greatly expanded tracking of version numbers.  Be aware
that bless now requires all classes throughout the @ISA heirarchy to
set their $VERSION since is_evolved compares them (and not the @ISA
tree).

- Persistent per-class globals via a new $o->GLOBS() method.

- Improved the API for private root data.  Also, moved the private
root to a separate segment (so it's easier to study memory usage).

- $db->sync_INC uses unshift instead of push.


** 01-07-98 EMERGENCY RELEASE 1.23

- Fixed refcnt problems in bless & indices.  From now on, make sure
to check ossize as outlined in ./INSTALL:

  'make test', then save the output of 'ossize -c'.  Run 'make test'
  again and compare 'ossize -c' to the last snapshot.  The only thing
  that might be different is the addition of another empty segment (this
  is a known bug in safe references, example below).  If anything else
  changes, there is a serious refcnt bug!

- Indices now set readonly locks *ONLY* on fields that are used as
keys.

- Notification API.
