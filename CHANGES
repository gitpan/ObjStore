** 07-05-97 Released 1.06 

- Improved peek.  Now peek from the command line - 'ospeek <database>'!

- Database::get_all_roots Root::get_name

- Fixes...


** 07-03-97 Released 1.05

- ObjectStore exceptions trigger a dump of the perl call stack.

- Peek on sacks.

- Bug fixes.

- $store->set_fetch_policy(os_fetch_policy, os_int32)


** Released 1.03

- Investigated schema evolution.  Will provide a database evolver
going forward.

- Can't wait for reasonable tied arrays!  Added array-based Sacks.
They're not tied, but at least they're inefficient.

- Found and fixed problems with reference counting.  Now the tests
can be run and the database does not grow.

- Blessings are now persistent!  (Untested)

- Re-designed the make system again.

- Started writing documentation.  (Yawn.)


** Released 1.02

- Improved make file.  Fixed blib.  Usage now looks like this:

perl ./be [-nop] [-silent] [-verbose] <cmd>
   checked      - verify that the package is complete
   made         - run the compiler, toast the pop-tarts, etc.
   installed    - copy files to final install area
   uninstalled  - delete any files that were installed
   cleaned      - delete all temporary files
   manifest     - update the MANIFEST file
   dist         - create a tar.gz distribution file

- Fixed version numbering for Exporter.  1.2 => 1.02

- Added ObjStore::peek($var) - like Data::Dumper except that it will work better
on gigantic databases.  Only three elements are printed from large hashes,
while small hashes are printed completely.  The meaning of 'large' can be
customized (not yet).

- Installs the PoweredByOS.gif and publishes the path.


** Released 1.00

- The first release, written during a sixty day evaluation.
