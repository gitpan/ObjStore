------------------------------------------------------------ INSTALLATION

Tested Systems:

   perl 5.004_04, 5.004_53-5.004_54

   Solaris 2.5.1
     SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C++ 4.1 / ObjectStore 4.0.1, 4.0.2
     SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C++ 4.1 / ObjectStore 5.0.0, 5.0.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build process is non-standard and needs some explaination.

1. xemacs ./Config.pm

2. perl ./be

  If you have a problem with objectstore::get_unassigned_address_space(),
  just delete the code chunk and keep going.  This API is only available
  with OS 5.0 service pack #2.

  ./t/z_ospeek.t is very sensitive to the success of the other tests.

3. perl ./be test

     Since the test database now has data, this exercises different code.

4. perl ./be installed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you succeed on a system that is not listed in above, please send
a note to perl-objectstore@parallax.co.uk announcing your success!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

While 'be' was great for development, I acknowledge the need to move
to a Makefile.PL.  If somebody could contribute one, that'd be great.
For an example of a clean build, see 'solaris.out'.
