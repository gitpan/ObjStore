=head1 NAME

ObjStore - Perl Extension For C<ObjectStore> OODBMS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The new C<SQL> and the sunset of relational databases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ObjectStore is the market leader in object-oriented databases
http://www.odi.com (NASDAQ: ODIS).  They use a unique Cache-Forward
Architecture to make persistent data available in literally the most
efficient manner possible.

Prior to this joining of forces: ObjectStore was too radical a design
decision for many applications; and perl5 did not have a simple way of
storing complex data persistently.

Now there is an easy way to build database applications, especially if
you are concerned about preserving your ideals of data encapsulation.

=head1 WHAT IS PERSISTENT PERL?

It's just like normal perl, except that you can create data that
doesn't go away when your program exits.  This more permenant data
lives in files or raw disk partitions that are divided into databases.
And databases are comprised of...

=head1 PREREQUISITES

** 03-06-98 RELEASE 1.30

- Instant, effortless event dispatching for network distributed perl
objects using dynamic transactions.  (See ObjStore::Process :-)

- Minor changes to ObjStore::Table3 to support multiple index types
and the notion of a primary index.  Simplified the implementation of
ObjStore::AV::Set.  Now can be used as an index in an
ObjStore::Table3.  ObjStore::AV::Set changes are not backward
compatible.

- Persistent bless logic unnecessarily complains when blessing in
multiple databases.  Temporarily disabled the imperfect assertion.

- Added subscribe & unsubscribe to Databases & Segments.

- Added 'nextKey' method to ObjStore::HV & ObjStore::Index.  Reserved
the 'help' method of all persistent objects.

- Tweaks to ObjStore::CSV.

- Defect found and fixed in Tree::Fat.

- Always adding -DDEBUGGING to CFLAGS is wrong.  Fixed.

- posh now persists command history from prior sessions (5.004_58+).


** 02-21-98 RELEASE 1.29

- Complete, nesting, tied array support (5.004_58+).

- Rewrote ObjStore::AppInstance to eliminate unnecessarily confusing
data flow.  The new version is NOT backward compatible.

- Fixed a bug that allowed bad pointers to appear in tree nodes and
possibly other places.  Instances of this bug occurred rarely.

- Fixed an uninitialized pointer that was causing exceptions to turn
into BUS errors.  Added more regression tests.

- Fixed a minor bug in ObjStore::Path::Ref.
