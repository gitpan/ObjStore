UPGRADING

We have way too much data in OS/Perl.  If you do too, you will need to
evolve your databases.


** osp_evolve

You must use osp_evolve instead of ossevol.

  osp_evolve [-i class] <workdb> <evolvedb>+

osp_evolve is relatively fast.  It took 8 minutes to evolve a 32MB
database on an Ultra 1 running Solaris.  If you get an error about
avarray, just add '-i avarray' to the command line.


** osp_copy

If you also want to re-copy your databases, you can now use osp_copy.
It take about 8-10 times at long as osp_evolve, but it does a lot of
stuff and is written completely in perl.  All the data in my 32MB
database was copied into a mere 5.5MB.
