ObjStore       am+O  ObjectStore DBMS Interface                   JPRIT

Easy, flexible, lightning-fast persistent via ObjectStore.  Stores
scalars, hashes, and references without flattening.  Perl databases
can be accessed from C++ and/or Java.  Inversely, persistent C++ 
objects can be added back into Perl!

### RECENT CHANGES ###


** Released 1.05

- ObjectStore exceptions trigger a dump of the perl call stack.

- Peek on sacks.

- Bug fixes.

- $store->set_fetch_policy(os_fetch_policy, os_int32)


** Released 1.03

- Investigated schema evolution.  Will provide a database evolver
going forward.

- Can't wait for reasonable tied arrays!  Added array-based Sacks.
They're not tied, but at least they're inefficient.

can be run and the database does not grow.

- Blessings are now persistent!  (Untested)

- Re-designed the make system again.

- Started writing documentation.  (Yawn.)
