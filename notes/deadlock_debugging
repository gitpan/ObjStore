KEYWORDS:  deadlocks, enable_event_hooks, set_default_hooks

QUESTION:

I suspect there is deadlock in my program.  How could I tracking them
down?


ANSWER:

You can add the following calls after objectstore::initialize() and
before you open any databases.

  objectstore::enable_event_hooks();
  objectstore::set_default_hooks();

This will print out information about read/write locks the process
holds on specific segments/pages.
