QUESTION:

 When I run the oswebdemo, as suggested in the README file that comes
along with the installation, ie.

oswebdemo\working> ..\bin\initdb.exe extra.db d:\nt\msinternet\oswebdemo,
I get the following error message (the database is created but still 
I get this error):
Error    (): Error initializing message database
Error    (): Warning initializing 
VdkSessionNew returned error code: -20

ObjectStore CATALOG ERROR - No registered message catalog contains msg# (0)
[msg# (0) Message text is not available]
INDEX OBJECTS: Error in VdkSessionNew

What does this error mean and
What do I do?

ANSWER:


This error message indicates that Verity can not find its
configuration files that it needs to build indexes.

As suggested in the README file please make sure that:

1. Your PATH environment variable does indeed contain <%OSWEB_ROOTDIR%>\
examples\webdemo\bin.

2. Check to see if you are currently in the directory <%OSWEB_ROOTDIR%>\
examples\webdemo\working

3. Check to see if this directory (the working directory) has the following 
hierarchy:
  working
    common
      style
      style2
    vercol

Also make sure that the style directory contains the files
                 1,190 STYLE.DDD
                 1,703 STYLE.DID
                 1,026 STYLE.PDD
                   742 STYLE.SID
                    77 style.vgw
                1,145 STYLE.WLD
(this indicates the size and names of the files).

And, most importantly check to see if you indeed have the 
all the Verity files properly installed.

4. Check to see if the objectstore server is up and running.
