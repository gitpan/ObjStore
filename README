ObjStore       Rm+O  ObjectStore OODBMS Interface                 JPRIT

Interface to ObjectStore OODBMS (http://www.odi.com).  Stores perl
data directly in a database without flattening of either nested or
cyclic structures.  Includes interactive perl shell for examining and
editing arbitrary perl databases.  Virtual memory mechanism is used to
make access nearly as fast as memory mapped files.

Available via http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/ObjStore
