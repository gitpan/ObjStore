------------------------------------------------------------ INSTALLATION

*** If do not have (or cannot upgrade) to ObjectStore 5.1, you should
*** stick with version 1.40 of this extension.


Tested Configurations:

  + perl 5.004_04, 5.004_68


  + Solaris 2.5.1 & 2.6

     SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C++ 4.1 / ObjectStore 5.1


  + gmake

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** BUILD STEPS

1. edit lib/ObjStore/Config.pm

2. cd API; perl Makefile.PL; make install

3. cd ..; perl Makefile.PL

4. make

5. make test

6. make install

You have to install the API separately before building the rest of the
package.  This is because everything depends on the libosperl.so
library being in the right place.  (Is there a better way?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST SUITE

- ./t/zpeek.t is very sensitive to the success of the other tests.

- Keep running 'make test' until the database size matches.  It takes
me about three trials.  If it will not match, there is probably a
serious REFCNT problem.  If you are feeling paranoid, you can check
that object counts do not increase between runs with 'ossize -c'.

- The mailing list wants to know if something strange happens!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you succeed on a system not listed (above) please send a note to
the mailing list announcing your success!
