ObjStore       Rm+O  ObjectStore OODBMS Interface                 JPRIT

Interface to ObjectStore OODBMS (http://www.odi.com).  Stores scalars,
sets, hashes, and references directly in the database without any
flattening of nested or circular structures.  Virtual memory mechanism
used to make read/write access nearly as fast as memory mapped files.
Includes CGI support module for `Perl Embedded HTML'.

Available via http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/ObjStore
