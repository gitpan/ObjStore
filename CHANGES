** 10-11-97 Released 1.17

- PERL / OBJECTSTORE SHELL !!

- First-class cursors for collections.

- osp_copy script to copy databases.  Source code included.

- Support for cross database references.

- Simplified API for 'open'.

- Sets depreciated.  The interface is there, but they are
re-implemented with hashes.


** 10-03-97 Released 1.16

- All transient data related to persistent memory is now garbage
collected immediately after a transaction finishes.  This should fix
any strange reference count problems that extensive testing has been
uncovering.  I am very interested to see any examples of code that
still leaks memory.  To recover memory already lost, a script to copy
databases is in the works.

- The default stargate now destroys data as it is copied into the
database.  This is necessary to prevent the inadvertant creation of
uncollectable cyclic structures.


** 09-27-97 Released 1.15

- Expanded analysis of Perl, Java, C++, and SQL as database languages.

- Partial arrays.  Mileage may vary.

- Automatic retry in the event of deadlock (69).

- Blessed objects now try to 'require' their class the first time they
are instantiated in transient memory.

- Renamed $Exception to $EXCEPTION.

- PHTML.pm and Eval.pm moved to their own distribution.


** 08-16-97 Released 1.11

- Update refcnts for transient referers in update & abort_only
transactions.  Persistent memory leaks no longer possible.

- ospeek restricted to show only three instances per class.


** 08-11-97 Released 1.10

- Overloaded the '""' (stringify) operator for persistent objects.

- ospeek [-addr]

- Important typemap fixes plus other minor stuff.


** 08-06-97 Released 1.09

- At our site we are now using osperl for about 2GB worth of data!

- Persistent blessings now fully tested and working.

- ObjectStore transactions and exceptions now fully integrated into
Perl.  Cursors have been removed from persistent data; read_only
transactions now properly supported.  Read_only transactions are
blazingly fast!

- Regularized allocators.  Specify cardinality when creating containers.
  new ObjStore::$type($near, $card);  Customize representation selector.

- Regularized peristent typing in preparation for extensibility.

- Peek rewrite with ideas from Data::Dumper.  Peek on circular data
structures.  Peek reports percent utilization to the delight of the
accountants everywhere.

- Unions removed from the schema.  This fix makes it possible to
evolve databases in the event of future schema enhancements.

- Reference counts are now 32bits wide and check for overflow.

- Static functions (e.g. ObjStore::Segment::of) are now called with ::
instead of -> for greater efficiency.  You wouldn't want to subclass
the core classes anyway.


** 07-05-97 Released 1.06 

- Improved peek.  Now peek from the command line - 'ospeek <database>'!


** Released 1.03

- Can't wait for reasonable tied arrays!  Added array-based Sets.
They're not tied, but at least they're inefficient.

- Found and fixed problems with reference counting.  Now the tests
can be run and the database does not grow.

- Blessings now persistent!  (Untested)


** Released 1.02

- Added ObjStore::peek($var) - like Data::Dumper except that it will work better
on gigantic databases.  Only three elements are printed from large hashes,
while small hashes are printed completely.  The meaning of 'large' can be
customized (not yet).


** Released 1.00

- The first release, written during our 60 day ObjectStore evaluation.
Why does ObjectStore have a reputation of being difficult to work with?
