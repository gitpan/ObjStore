=head1 NAME

ObjStore - Perl Extension For C<ObjectStore> OODBMS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The new C<SQL> and the sunset of relational databases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ObjectStore is the market leader in object-oriented databases
http://www.odi.com (NASDAQ: ODIS).  They use a unique Cache-Forward
Architecture to make persistent data available in literally the most
efficient manner possible.

Prior to this joining of forces: ObjectStore was too radical a design
decision for many applications; and perl5 did not have a simple way of
storing complex data persistently.

Now there is an easy way to build database applications, especially if
you are concerned about preserving your ideals of encapsulation.

=head2 INCLUDED TOOLS

=over 4

=item * ospeek

Prints out databases in Data::Dumper style.

=item * posh

Like C<sh>/C<csh>, except that you can I<change directory> B<into>
your database and walk around the data from the inside.  You can also
invoke methods on your objects or write custom reports (in perl, of
course :-).

=item * osperlserver

Run it against any database that inherits C<ObjStore::ServerDB> and it
will provide a remote method invokation service.

- Tree::Fat & Test perl extensions

- ExtUtils::ExCxx (only needed on Digital UNIX, HP (5.x), OS/2 (3.x),

# RECENT CHAN@ES #
##################


** 03-28-98 RELEASE 1.33

- Stringification of persistent objects can no longer cause
ObjectStore exceptions.  Error reporting is therefore much more
robust.

- Use ObjStore::NoInit to delay initialization of the ObjectStore
library.  This opens time to modify configuration parameters (or
for forking) before becoming a known OS client.

- First-cut at database job scheduling.  See ObjStore::Job.

- Blessings were not sticking to databases in certain cases.  Fixed.


** 03-21-98 RELEASE 1.32

- Major improvements to serverization code.  See osperlserver,
ObjStore::ServerDB, and ObjStore::Process.  It is likely that not all
changes are backward compatible to 1.30 (but I'm pretty sure
improvements will outweigh breakage :-).

- ObjStore::AV::Set now checks for duplicates.
