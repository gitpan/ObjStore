** Installation


Tested Systems:
   sun4-solaris / SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C++ 4.1 / ObjectStore 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 5.0.0


The build process is a bit radical and needs some hand-holding.

1. 'perl ./be help'

2. Make any necessary changes and run 'perl ./be'.

3. It should build an './blib/bin/osperl' binary and run the test scripts.
   './t/hash.t' fails 2/4 until bugrep015834 is fixed.

4. 'perl ./be installed'


If you succeed on a system that is not listed in above, please send
a note to perl-objectstore@parallax.co.uk announcing your success!
