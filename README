ObjStore       Rm+O  ObjectStore OODBMS Interface                 JPRIT

Interface to ObjectStore OODBMS (http://www.odi.com).  Stores scalars,
sets, hashes, and references directly in the database without any
flattening of nested or circular structures.  Uses the virtual memory
mechanism to make read/write access nearly as fast as memory mapped
files.  Databases can be accessed from Perl, C++, or Java.  Designed
for easy extension of the internal data representation or data types
of built-in data structures.

### FUTURE PLANS ###

Preliminary design of Verity full text indexing interface below.  Should
the index membership be kept in each member or not?  Leaning towards 'no'.

$Txt->index($indexHandle, $userPointer)
	$indexHandle - the specific Verity index object
	$userPointer - returned together with the match score after a search

  This can be called multiple times for different indexes.

$Txt->reindex;                   # call if string is changed
$Txt->unindex([$indexHandle]);
