------------------------------------------------------------ INSTALLATION


Tested Configurations:


+ perl 5.005_02 (fails some tests but mostly okay)
  perl 5.005_53 (passes all tests)


+ Solaris 2.5.1 (2.6 should work too)

  SC4.0 18 Oct 1995 C++ 4.1 / ObjectStore 5.1

  ** REQUIRED: ODI fix #13866 (_Rep_desc_type_table::dope_compatible
               forgets to fixup name key in name hash table)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** BUILD STEPS

0. If you want to install into a non-default directory tree, set the
PERL5PREFIX environment variable.

1. edit ./lib/ObjStore/Config.pm

2. cd API; perl Makefile.PL; make install

3. cd ..; perl Makefile.PL

4. make

5. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=blib/arch/auto/ObjStore make test  (or somesuch)

6. make install

You have to install the API separately before building the rest of the
package since everything depends on libosperl.so being in the right
place.  (There must be a better way?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEST SUITE

- ./t/zpeek.t is very sensitive to the success of the other tests.

- Keep running 'make test' until the database size matches.  It takes
me about three tries.  If it will not match, there is probably a
serious reference count problem.  If you are feeling paranoid, you can
check that object counts do not increase between runs with 'ossize -c
<database>'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TROUBLE SHOOTING

- Depending on the platform and whether you built perl to a shared or
static library, you might need to disable perl's malloc.  This does
not seem to be necessary on Solaris 2.X.

- If you need to get a stack trace of an ObjectStore exceptions,
you'll need to use the following breakpoints:

  # optional
  stop in osp_croak
  stop in Perl_croak
  stop in `libc.so.1`abort

  # manditory
  stop in `ObjStore.so`XS_ObjStore__SEGV_reason
  ignore SEGV
  cont

- Send any problem reports to the mailing list!

Once you succeed on a system not listed (above) please send a note to
perl-objectstore@parallax.co.uk announcing your success!
