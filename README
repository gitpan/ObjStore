ObjStore       Rm+O  ObjectStore OODBMS Interface                 JPRIT

Interface to ObjectStore OODBMS (http://www.odi.com).  Stores scalars,
arrays, hashes, sets, and references directly in the database without
any flattening of nested or circular structures.  Virtual memory
mechanism used to make read/write access nearly as fast as memory
mapped files.

### RECENT CHANGES ###


** 10-03-97 Released 1.16

- All transient data related to persistent memory is now garbage
collected immediately after a transaction finishes.  This should fix
any strange reference count problems that extensive testing has been
uncovering.  I am very interested to see any examples of code that
still leaks memory.  To recover memory already lost, a script to copy
databases is in the works.

- The default stargate now destroys data as it is copied into the
database.  This is necessary to prevent the inadvertant creation of
uncollectable circular structures.

- Started implementation of persistent cursors.


** 09-27-97 Released 1.15

- Expanded analysis of Perl, Java, C++, and SQL as database languages.

- Partial arrays.  Mileage may vary.

- Automatic retry in the event of deadlock (69).

- Blessed objects now try to 'require' their class the first time they
are instantiated in transient memory.

- Renamed $Exception to $EXCEPTION.

- PHTML.pm and Eval.pm moved to their own distribution.
