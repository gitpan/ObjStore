=head1 NAME

ObjStore - Perl Extension For C<ObjectStore> OODBMS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Enjoy perl?  Sick of SQL?  Ready to try something new?

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ObjectStore is the market leader in object-oriented databases
http://www.odi.com (NASDAQ: ODIS).  They use a unique Cache-Forward
Architecture to make persistent data available in literally the most
efficient manner possible.

Prior to this joining of forces: ObjectStore was too radical a design
decision for many applications; and perl5 did not have a simple way of
storing complex data persistently.  Now there is an easy way to build
database applications, especially if you are concerned about
preserving your ideals of encapsulation.

=head2 INCLUDED TOOLS

=over 4

=item * ospeek

Prints out databases in Data::Dumper style.

=item * posh & qtposh

Like C<sh>/C<csh>, except that you can I<change directory> B<into>
your database and walk around the data from the inside.  You can also
invoke methods on your objects or write custom reports (in perl, of
course :-).  (Also similar to C<isql>/C<wisql>.)

=item * osperlserver

Provides remote method invokation, database job scheduling, and
server-object collaboration services.  Completely generic.

# RECENT CHAN@ES #
##################


** 04-10-98 RELEASE 1.36

- Added ObjStore::Posh::Remote & qtposh.  However, qtposh may not work
without patches for Event and PerlQt.  Mileage may vary.

- Various minor fixes.


** 04-06-98 RELEASE 1.35

- Another read-only mode is available for ObjStore::Index.  A
distinction is made between exclusive and shared read-only keys.
The default mode has been changed to _exclusive_ read-only.
Also added support for shift and pop.

- Delay object destruction with ObjStore::Mortician.  Also, general
improvements to the serverization modules.

- Optimized typemap slightly.  Also fixed typemap bugs in
ObjStore::Index::seek & ObjStore::Index::configure.  Optimized
reallocation of (persistent) memory in string assignments.  (1.34 code
was buggy!)

- Overloaded == & != operator tests no longer work if either argument
is non-persistent.  While this breaks backward compatiblility, I
believe the extra strictness is worth it.

- The automatic safe_require code was apparently a bit _TOO_ safe.
Exceptions were been hidden!  Fixed.

- Improved Digital AXP hints.
